 # Design Patterns
</div>

* Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.
* They are like pre-made blueprints that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.
* There are 3 types:
  * Creational patterns
  * Structural patterns
  * Behavioral patterns
 
## Creational Patterns
* Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

## Structural Patterns
* Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

## Behavioral Patterns
* Behavioral design patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
